This project is mainly to resolve the compatibility issue between fijkplayer (https://pub.dev/packages/fijkplayer 0.8.7) and flutter_ffmpeg (https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_ffmpeg 0.3.0). In iOS, if you use those 2 components at the same time, you will encounter crash issue due to different ffmpeg versions. This project will keep fijkplayer's ffmpeg and force flutter_ffmpeg to use fijkplayer's ffmpeg.
